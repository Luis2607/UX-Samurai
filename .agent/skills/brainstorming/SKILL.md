# Brainstorming & Design

## When to use this skill
- Before creating any feature, component, or functionality.
- When requirements are vague or high-level ("make it better").
- When the user has an idea but no implementation plan.

## Workflow

1.  **Explore**: Check current project context (files, docs).
2.  **Clarify**: Ask questions one at a time to refine the idea.
3.  **Propose**: Suggest 2-3 approaches with trade-offs.
4.  **Present**: Show the design in sections and get approval.
5.  **Document**: Save the validated design.
6.  **Transition**: Invoke planning skill.

## Instructions

**Do NOT write code until the design is approved.**

### Process Flow

1.  **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria. Prefer multiple-choice questions.
2.  **Present Options**: Explain "Why" for your recommendation.
3.  **Get Approval**: "Does this design look right so far?"

### Design Output

Ideally, produce a design document covering:
-   **Goal**: What are we solving?
-   **User Story**: Who is it for?
-   **Technical Approach**: Components, Data Flow, APIs.
-   **Testing Strategy**: How will we verify this?

### Anti-Pattern
"This is too simple to design." -> False. Even simple changes benefit from a quick "Here is what I plan to do" check.

## Resources
- No specific templates needed; focus on conversation.
